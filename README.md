# asmasm
This is like __*asm.js*__? No. No, not at all. They serve very different purposes.

This will help make the web even faster? Uhh. No.

This is like web-assembly? Okay, maybe a little bit.

## So, what the hell *is* asmasm, then?
__*asmasm*__ is an assembly language for a virtual machine that can only be represented through a combination of hardware virtualization/software.

<sup>and this project is in the public domain because we aren't about that copyright crap</sup>

Okay, now in English?

__*asmasm*__ is simple enough to write by hand, but also simple enough for being the target of higher level programming langauges. Our paradigm is simple. __If we can make it simple for machines, we can make it simple for humans, too.__ That way everyone wins and our robot overlords are appeased.

## Yeah that's great and all... how do I get started?
